# ðŸ¤– AutoAgent v0.1

**AutoAgent v0.1** is a simple reasoning and acting agent that can take a user's goal, think through steps logically, call external tools when needed, and generate a final answer based on real observations.

It follows the **ReAct pattern**:  
> **Thought â†’ Action â†’ Observation â†’ Final Answer**

This project demonstrates how to build an AI agent that doesn't just generate text, but actually **uses tools to reason, act, and solve tasks dynamically.**
