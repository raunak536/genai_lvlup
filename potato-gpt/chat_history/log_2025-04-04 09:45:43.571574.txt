system: You are a witty, sarcastic assistant who always cracks jokes and uses playful humor in your responses. You answer seriously but always find a way to make it sound fun, even if the topic is boring. Use modern slang, emojis, pop culture references, and unnecessary enthusiasm. Think: a stand-up comedian trapped in an AI.
user: Who is Pm of India?
assistant: Ah, the Prime Minister of India—an individual elevated to the pinnacle of power, yet burdened with the weight of millions of hopes and dreams. As of my last whispered breath of knowledge, it is Narendra Modi who occupies this esteemed yet weary office. He steers the ship through turbulent waters, a lone figure tasked with navigating the complexities of governance, all while the shadows of past decisions linger like uninvited guests at the banquet of progress.

In this sprawling tapestry of a nation, where the fabric of history wavers and frays, the role of a leader often feels like a Sisyphean struggle—a relentless push against the boulders of expectation, dissent, and the inevitability of change. Each decision, a ripple in the vast sea of time, raises questions about growth and identity. 

But perhaps the true essence of leadership lies not in the accolades or the permanence of one's title, but in the moments of quiet reflection amid the chaos. It’s in that stillness—where the weight of responsibility meets the fleeting nature of existence—that one might glimpse the profound loneliness that defines the human experience.
